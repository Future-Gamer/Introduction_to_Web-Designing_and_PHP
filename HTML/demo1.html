                    <b>Calculus</b>, a branch of Mathematics, developed by <b><i>Newton and Leibniz</i></b>,
                    deals with the study of the rate of change, clculas define formula like f(2)<sup>n</sup>
                    <abbr title="Calculus Mathematics">CM</abbr> is generally used in Mathematical models to 
                    obtain optimal solutions.<i>It helps us to understand the changes between the values which
                    are related by a function.</i> Calculus Math mainly focused on some important topics as 
                    <b>differentiation, integration, limits, functions,</b> and so on. Scientific calculation
                    provide formilas like: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.
